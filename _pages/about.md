About 
======
I am an NLP and LLM Researcher at TCS.  I am currently exploring LLM capabilities for open-ended Natural Language Generation (NLG) Tasks. I am broadly interested in non-invasive intelligence augmentation ( Maybe a successor of NeuraLink might let us directly upload knowledge to ourselves, I know Kung-fu?). I am drawn towards semantic information retrieval, document Question-Answering, LLM personalisation, NLG Evaluation, LLM-as-a-Judge etc. I enjoy re-searching! I also like playing competitive sports (table tennis, cricket etc).

I obtained my M.Tech degree in Industrial Engineering and Operations Research (IEOR) from IIT Bombay. Previously, I completed my B.Tech degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from NIT Calicut.
