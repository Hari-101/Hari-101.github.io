## Response Generation from an LLM/ Inference

Model Represenation | Model Learning | Model Inference


Here, "final" means whenever you feel like the model has been sufficiently trained such that you feel ready to start eliciting responses from it. This could be a base model or a fine-tuned model or even a randomly initialised model!
